							<h2>Decarbonisation Investment under Uncertainty</h2>

							<p>The 4th edition of our PhD summer school series focuses on decarbonisation investments under uncertainty. This topic is crucial in today's global context, where investment decisions are significantly impacted by policy volatility, technological advancements, and market dynamics.</p>

							<p>Understanding how uncertainty affects low-carbon technology investments is essential for designing effective climate policies and accelerating the energy transition. Research shows that policy uncertainty can delay green investments, potentially hindering progress towards climate goals.</p>

							<h2>Program Elements</h2>

							<h3>Expert Lectures</h3>
							<p>Engage with prominent academics through lectures on foundational theories and practical insights related to energy transition. These sessions will cover topics such as uncertainty in energy transition models, investment under uncertainty in future energy systems, and the role of directed innovation in climate change mitigation.</p>

							<h3>Interactive Group Projects</h3>
							<p>Participate in group projects analyzing policy instruments across different countries and sectors. You'll have the opportunity to examine various aspects such as governance, optimization background, and instrument interactions. This hands-on approach will help you understand the complexities of policy design and implementation in real-world scenarios.</p>

							<h3>Research Pitches</h3>
							<p>Present your research ideas to senior researchers in small groups, receiving valuable feedback and guidance. This unique opportunity allows you to refine your research proposals and gain insights from experienced academics in the field.</p>

							<h3>Policy Panel</h3>
							<p>Connect academic discussions with real-world applications through engaging policy panels featuring industry experts and policymakers. This session will provide a "big picture" perspective on how theoretical concepts translate into practical policy decisions.</p>

							<h3>Networking Opportunities</h3>
							<p>Build connections with fellow students and top academics in the field of energy and climate economics. The summer school aims to foster a network of researchers interested in the theoretical analysis of energy and climate policies.</p>
